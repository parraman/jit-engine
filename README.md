# Support for LLVM-based JIT

This project contains a set of classes to support JIT using LLVM. Currently, only LLVM version 9 is supported. The code is based on:

- The LLVM [tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT1.html) on JIT
- The [JitFromScratch](https://github.com/weliveindetail/JitFromScratch) project.

## Installation of LLVM-9

If you are using Linux, you can download and install LLVM-9 using a pre-built package.
